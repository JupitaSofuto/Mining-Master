## ðŸ“– About

Mining Master is a mod that adds 10 new 'Enchanting Ores' to the game. These ores, when applied to a tool or armour-piece on a Smithing Table, bestow an Enchantment!
Using further Enchanting Ores on the same piece of equipment will up the enchantment level, too.
The 10 ores are:

## Overworld

### Fire Ruby
- Grants Flame, Fire Aspect, or Fire Protection, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under desert biomes.

### Ice Sapphire
- Grants Frost Walker or Freezing, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under icy biomes.

### Spirit Garnet
- Grants Thorns, Leeching, or Loyalty, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under extremely hilly biomes.

### Haste Peridot
- Grants Efficiency, Quick Draw, or Lure, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under jungle biomes.

### Lucky Citrine
- Grants Fortune, Looting, or Luck of the Sea, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under mesa biomes.

### Dive Aquamarine
- Grants Aqua Affinity, Riptide, or Grace, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under mesa biomes.

## Nether

### Power Pyrite
- Grants Power (of course), Sharpness, or Stonebreaker, dependent on the item. Most commonly found in the Nether Wastes.

### Heart Rhodonite
- Grants Heartfelt, which can be applied to all armour pieces. Most commonly found in the Soul Sand Valley.

### Kinetic Opal
- Grants Blast Protection, Smelting, or Runner, dependent on the item. Most commonly found in the Basalt Deltas.

## End

### Malachite Meteorite
- A meteorite made of two new blocks, Malacrust and Malacore. Contains Air Malachite Ore floating within.

### Air Malachite
- Grants Feather Falling, Knight Jump, or Floatation, dependent on the item. Most commonly found beyond the End Islands.

## Enchantments

We've added several new Enchantments that cannot be obtained in an Enchanting Table to flesh out some of these gems more, providing a greater incentive to mine them!

- Leeching - Swords and Axes. 25% of any damage dealt is restored back to the attacker as health on-hit.

- Freezing - Swords and Axes. Inflicts slowness and Criticals fire enemies.

- Snowpiercer - Leggings. Grants Speed when running on Snow and Ice blocks.

- Grace - Chestplates. Grants you the Dolphins Grace effect for a short amount of time, after which it will wear off and only activate again after having dried off on land. Pairs well with Depth Strider...

- Stonebreaker - Pickaxes. Destroys Stone, Cobblestone, Diorite, Granite, Andesite, and Netherrack, leaving no drops.

- Heartfelt - All Armours. Increases your maximum health by one heart per level. Damage each armour piece proportionally increases.

- Smelting - Pickaxes. Smelts mined ore blocks! Must be paired with Silk Touch to mine Nether Gold Ore.

- Runner - Boots. Increases your sprinting speed.

- Knight Jump - Leggings. Gives you an additional mid-air jump per level.

- Floatation - Bows. Inflicts enemies with Levitation.

It's a small mod, but we think it'll add a lot! We hope you enjoy it! :D
