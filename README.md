# Mining Master
## ðŸ“– About

Mining Master is a mod that adds 10 new 'Enchanting Ores' to the game.
These ores, when applied to a tool or armour-piece on a Smithing Table, bestow an Enchantment!
Using further Enchanting Ores on the same piece of equipment will up the enchantment level, too.
The 10 ores are:

## Enchantments

We've added several new Enchantments that cannot be obtained in an Enchanting Table to flesh out some of these gems more, providing a greater incentive to mine them!

- Leeching - Swords and Axes. 25% of any damage dealt is restored back to the attacker as health on-hit. III Levels.
- Freezing - Swords and Axes. Inflicts slowness and Criticals fire enemies. (Mod Compatibility can be achieved with a tag!) III Levels.
- Snowpiercer - Leggings. Grants Speed when running on Snow and Ice blocks. I Level.
- Grace - Chestplates. Grants you the Dolphins Grace effect for a short amount of time, after which it will wear off and only activate again after having dried off on land. Pairs well with Depth Strider... V Levels.
- Stonebreaker - Pickaxes. Destroys Stone, Cobblestone, Diorite, Granite, Andesite, and Netherrack, leaving no drops. I Level.
- Heartfelt - All Armours. Increases your maximum health by one heart per level. Damage each armour piece proportionally increases. II Levels.
- Smelting - Pickaxes. Smelts mined ore blocks! Must be paired with Silk Touch to mine Nether Gold Ore. I Level.
- Runner - Boots. Increases your sprinting speed. III levels.
- Knight Jump - Leggings. Gives you an additional mid-air jump per level. III Levels.
- Floatation - Bows. Inflicts enemies with Levitation. III levels.

It's a small mod, but we think it'll add a lot! We hope you enjoy it! :D
