# Mining Master
## ðŸ“– About

Mining Master is a small mod that adds 5 new 'Enchanting Ores' to the game.
These ores, when applied to a tool or armour-piece on a Smithing Table, bestow an Enchantment at level 1!
Using further Enchanting Ores on the same piece of equipment will level up the enchantment level, too.
The five ores are:

### Fire Ruby
- Grants Flame, Fire Aspect, or Fire Protection, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under desert biomes.

### Ice Sapphire
- Grants Frost Walker or Freezing, dependent on the item.Â Most commonly found under icy biomes.

### Spirit Garnet
- Grants Thorns, Leeching, or Loyalty, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under extremely hilly biomes.

### Haste Peridot
- Grants Efficiency, Quick Draw, or Lure, dependent on the item. Most commonly found under jungle biomes.

### Lucky Citrine
- Grants Fortune, Looting, or Luck of the Sea, dependent on the item.Â Most commonly found under mesa biomes.

We've also added two new Enchantments from Dungeons for the Garnet and the Sapphire respectively, those being:

- Leeching - 25% of any damage dealt is restored back to the attacker as health on-hit.
- Freezing - Inflicts slowness and Criticals fire enemies. (Mod Compatibility can be achieved with a tag!)

It's a small mod, but we think it'll add a lot! We hope you enjoy it! :D
